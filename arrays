//An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:
//Creating an Array

//syntax
const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];

//Formats
//Format1
//Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

/syntax
const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];

//Format2
//You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";

//Format3
//Using the JavaScript Keyword new
//The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:
const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");

//Accessing Array Elements
//You access an array element by referring to the index number:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];
